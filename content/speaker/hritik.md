#### Shedding the VMware Layer: A Migration to Bare Metal Infrastructure

Are you grappling with the high costs and inefficiencies of a VM-based Kubernetes setup? You’re not alone. Many organizations face VM sprawl, rising licensing fees, and performance bottlenecks. This talk explores a bold shift to bare metal infrastructure, where simplicity meets scalability. We’ll cover why shedding the VMware layer makes sense, how to streamline your architecture, and tools like namespaces and vCluster to enable multi-tenancy without virtualization overhead. 

Learn practical migration strategies and hear Aussie Broadband’s real-world success story: consolidating 200 VMs, 1,000+ CPU cores, and 1TB of RAM into a single bare metal cluster using OSS vCluster, cutting VMware costs to $0. Join me to future proof your infra.
