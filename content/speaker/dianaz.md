#### Stop Waiting, Start Migrating: Start Your OpenStack Journey Today

In todayâ€™s fast-evolving world of information technology, many applications now demand scalable and flexible infrastructure resources. At the same time, companies are facing increasing challenges with rising licensing costs from proprietary platforms. It's not uncommon for organizations to voice concerns over their growing monthly operational expenses.

OpenStack emerges as an open-source solution that offers cost efficiency, flexibility, and full control over infrastructure. However, many organizations remain hesitant to migrate due to perceived complexities and risks. In reality, delaying the migration might actually lead to greater long-term losses.

In this session, I will cover:

1. Why now is the right time to migrate to OpenStack
2. Key considerations before initiating a migration
3. Effective migration strategies, including pre-, during-, and post-migration phases
4. Tools and technical approaches to simplify the migration process


This session is aimed at IT professionals, cloud engineers, and decision-makers who are exploring or planning a move to OpenStack.
