#### Hyperscaler Exit Strategy: Building Your Own Private Cloud with Confidence

For organizations with predictable workloads, hyperscaler costs can be prohibitive. This session details a practical 'Hyperscaler Exit Strategy' for building a cost-effective private cloud with confidence. Learn how to leverage accessible IaaS platforms like Proxmox or CloudStack—avoiding OpenStack's steep learning curve—as a foundation for modern orchestrators like Kubernetes or Nomad. We'll also cover replacing proprietary services with powerful open-source tools like MinIO for object storage and ClickHouse for data warehousing, enabling significant cost savings, data sovereignty, and freedom from vendor lock-in.
