#### Are Containers Dying? Rethinking Isolation with MicroVMs

Virtualization has been around for years, helping us solve real-world problems while introducing trade-offs we need to consider. Technologies like virtual machines and containers each come with their own performance, security, and operational considerations. This talk will explore the current limitations of container technology and examine potential solutions. We'll dive into what microVMs are, how they fit into today's technology landscape, and the technical foundations that make them different from existing solutions.

The discussion will focus on practical decision-making: when to choose containers versus microVMs. We'll analyze the factors that should influence your technology choices, examining both the strengths and limitations of each approach. From usage and security perspectives, what lessons we can learn and how these technologies complement each other in modern infrastructure.
