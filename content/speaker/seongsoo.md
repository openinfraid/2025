#### Contributing to OpenStack: Tools, Community, and Mentorship from Korea

Getting involved in OpenStack can feel overwhelming at first — with a large global community, a diverse technical ecosystem, and a unique contribution process.

In this session, we will break down the structure of the OpenStack global community, introduce key tools and technologies used in contribution workflows, and share how the Korea User Group has supported new contributors through a structured mentorship program.

Whether you’re looking to make your first patch or build a local contribution program, this session will offer insights and practical knowledge to help you (or your community) take the next step in participating in OpenStack development.
