#### Building Real-Time Incident Analytics with Apache Flink and Kafka on OpenStack

Abstract
This session demonstrates how to build a scalable, real-time incident analytics platform using Apache Flink and Kafka deployed on OpenStack. Leveraging OpenStackâ€™s compute, networking, and storage services, we show how to provision and manage the infrastructure required to ingest, process, and analyze streaming data for incident detection and response. Attendees will learn how to architect fault-tolerant, low-latency analytics pipelines with open-source tools running on private cloud infrastructure.

Tools & Technologies
- Apache Kafka (Distributed event streaming)
- Apache Flink (Real-time stream processing)
- OpenStack (Compute, networking, and storage infrastructure)

Key Takeaways
- Deploy and manage Kafka and Flink clusters on OpenStack infrastructure
- Architect real-time streaming pipelines for incident detection and analysis
- Automate infrastructure provisioning and scaling with Terraform and Ansible
- Build fault-tolerant, cloud-agnostic analytics systems using open-source software
